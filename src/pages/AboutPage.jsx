                            I come from stockholm, and been fortunate to be nurtured in an
                            environment filled with art, music, and creativity. This has shaped my
                            personal development in life, leading me to always strive for passion.
                            I am driven by my curiosity and motivation to seek new knowledge; for
                            this reason, I set my sights on new challenges and embarked on my new
                            adventure. After 20 years in the construction industry as an
                            electrician, I have today begun my new journey as a full-stack
                            developer specializing in .NET. My goal is to continue my development
                            in a digital world, where my skills, strengths, and above all, my
                            knowledge from past experiences, will come in handy. A digital world
                            where I can think outside the box and grow alongside the challenges it
                            presents.
